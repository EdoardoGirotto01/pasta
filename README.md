# PASTA: Probabilistic Answer Set programming for STAtistical probabilities

This software allows to perform inference in probabilistic answer set programs under the credal semantics and with statistical statements. 

## Syntax
Probabilistic facts can be added with the syntax: `prob::atom.` where `prob` is a floating point number (0 < number <= 1) and `atom` is a standard ASP fact.
For example, `0.5::a.` states that `a` has probability `0.5`.

For more examples, see the `examples` folder.
